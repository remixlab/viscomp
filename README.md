Refer to the [reveal folder structure](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#folder-structure) for more details, and to the *Setup* below.


## Setup

External markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the slides source code.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli)

3. Clone the VisComp repository

 ```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/nakednous/viscomp.git
 ```

4. Navigate to the viscomp folder

 ```sh
 $ cd viscomp
 ```

5. Install dependencies

 ```sh
 $ npm install
 ```

6. Create a presentation

 ```sh
 # replace *n* with the number of the presentation to be created:
 $ cp -r lectures/template/ lectures/n
 # uncomment lines 49-55 (section block) and edit line 50 to reflect *n* above:
 $ nano lectures/n/index.html
 # edit the presentation source using markdown:
 $ nano lectures/n/source.md
 $ ln -s lectures/n/index.html index.html
 ```
 *Note:* `lectures/1` followed the aforementioned method.

7. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes

 ```sh
 $ grunt serve
 ```

8. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation

 You can change the port by using `grunt serve --port 8001`.

9. Update to upstream

 ```sh
 $ git remote add reveal.js https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
 $git pull reveal.js master
 ```
